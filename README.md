# Python Dictionary App

The Python Dictionary App is a simple command-line application that allows users to look up words and receive their corresponding definitions.

## Functionality

- Accepts user input to look up words in the dictionary.
- Displays definitions for the entered word(s).
- Handles non-existent words and provides appropriate messages.
- Allows graceful exit from the application.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Dictionary-App.git

How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.

Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.

Create a "dictionary.json" file in the same directory as the script with the following format:

{
    "apple": ["A fruit with red or yellow or green skin and sweet to tart crisp whitish flesh"],
    "banana": ["An elongated curved fruit"],
    "chocolate": ["A food made from roasted ground cacao beans"],
    // Add more words and their definitions as needed
}

Run the app by executing the following command in the terminal:
    python dictionary_app.py
Enter a word you want to look up, and the app will display its definition(s) if found in the dictionary. If the word is not found, the app will inform you accordingly.

To exit the app, type 'exit' or 'quit'.
